# Agent Tracing

ToolTrace can ingest local lifecycle hooks from Codex and Claude Code and show
them in the same run timeline as SDK-instrumented agents.

## Quickstart

Start the local collector and dashboard:

```bash
pnpm --filter @tooltrace/cli build
node packages/cli/dist/index.js dev
```

Install global hooks in another terminal:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js install codex --scope user --redaction metadata
node packages/cli/dist/index.js install claude-code --scope user --redaction metadata
```

Run Codex or Claude Code normally, then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000/runs
```

Uninstall the hooks with:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js uninstall codex
node packages/cli/dist/index.js uninstall claude-code
```

## Smoke Test

You can verify hook ingestion without launching either agent. Start the local
collector, then run:

```bash
node examples/agent-hook-smoke.mjs
```

The smoke script posts representative Codex and Claude Code hook payloads to:

- `POST /integrations/codex/hook`
- `POST /integrations/claude-code/hook`

It then reads `/runs/:id/events` and verifies:

- Codex `SessionStart` becomes a `run_started` event.
- Codex `PostToolUse` becomes a successful `tool_call` event.
- Claude Code `PostToolUseFailure` becomes an error `tool_call` event.
- Raw prompts are not persisted.
- Executed shell commands are persisted so the dashboard can show what ran.

## Token Usage

ToolTrace stores official usage numbers when the agent source provides them.
When official usage is missing, it estimates exposed Codex and Claude Code hook
prompt/output text locally with a tiktoken-compatible tokenizer and marks those
values as `estimated`.

For Codex, prefer the official OpenTelemetry log export when you need accurate
token usage. Configure Codex with an OTLP/HTTP JSON log exporter that points at
the local collector:

```toml
[otel]
log_user_prompt = false
exporter = { otlp-http = {
  endpoint = "http://localhost:4319/integrations/codex/otel/v1/logs",
  protocol = "json"
}}
```

Codex OTel `response.completed`/SSE usage fields are normalized into
`metadata.tokenUsage` as official usage. The collector also accepts the same
payload at `/v1/logs` for OTLP-compatible local testing.
When Codex telemetry exposes reasoning output tokens, ToolTrace stores them in
`metadata.tokenUsage.reasoningOutput`. If the payload does not provide an
official total, ToolTrace includes those reasoning tokens in the derived
`total`; if an official `total_tokens` value is present, that value remains
authoritative to avoid double counting.

For Claude Code, ToolTrace reads usage fields that are present in hook payloads.
Completed Claude Code `Agent` tool responses can include `totalTokens` and a
`usage` object with `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
`cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`; ToolTrace stores
those directly without recalculating them. When those fields are absent,
ToolTrace estimates exposed `UserPromptSubmit.prompt` input and
`Stop.last_assistant_message` output locally.

Fallback estimates only cover text that Codex and Claude Code hooks expose to
the collector, such as `UserPromptSubmit.prompt` and
`Stop.last_assistant_message`. They do not include hidden reasoning, unexposed
system context, conversation history, or tool payloads that remain redacted.

Set `TOOLTRACE_ENDPOINT` to target a non-default collector:

```bash
TOOLTRACE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4319 node examples/agent-hook-smoke.mjs
```

## Privacy Defaults

The first tracing mode is `metadata`. In this mode ToolTrace stores:

- agent source, such as `codex` or `claude-code`
- session, turn, prompt, and tool-use IDs when hooks provide them
- hook event names, tool names, status, duration, model, permission mode, and
  redaction level
- executed command text for command tools
- official token usage when the source event provides it, or local estimates
  when exposed hook prompt/output text is the only available source
- payload sizes or text lengths for prompts and non-command tool input/output

ToolTrace does not store these fields by default:

- raw prompts
- raw tool input or output
- file contents
- hidden model reasoning

Future debug modes may opt in to richer content capture, but that should remain
explicit and separate from the default metadata mode.

## Known Limits

- The hook integration records events that Codex and Claude Code expose through
  local hooks; it does not capture hidden reasoning.
- Cloud-hosted or web-only agent internals are not visible unless they emit
  events through a supported local hook or future telemetry adapter.
- ToolTrace intentionally does not rely on unstable transcript file formats.
- Token usage prefers source-provided official fields or Codex OTel. Hook-only
  prompt/output payloads from Codex or Claude Code use local estimates and are
  marked as estimated.
